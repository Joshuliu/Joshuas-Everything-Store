# Joshua's Everything Store

### https://joshuliu.github.io/Joshuas-Everything-Store/

A basic static HTML website written from scratch, featuring usage of CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. This website is the final project of a short HTML/CSS/JS course I took, in which I was instructed to put everything I learned together creatively.

## Notes
* The login button is very static and does not actually do anything but change the button text to what you inputted as your username to simulate that you logged in to an account. 
* I do not own a grocery store neither online nor in person. Therefore, the actual individual fruits/vegtables sites all state that the product is sold out. However, if you are willing to pay for an item over $300.00, please reach out and we can definitely work something out.
